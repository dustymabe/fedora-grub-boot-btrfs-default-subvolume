Subject: [PATCH 88/91] Fix locale issue in grub-setpassword (#1294243)

A shell substitution was expecting non-translated output to grab the
hashed password and put it in the user.cfg file. Modified code to force
the generic C locale when this particular piece of code is run.

Resolves: rhbz#1294243
